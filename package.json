  "description": "Navigate to the root of your project and run npm init -y â€” this will initialize a package.json file for your project. The package.json file is required for installing third party npm packages and saving their version numbers. If you fail to initialize a package.json file, it will be troublesome, and at times almost impossible for anyone else to run your code after cloning your project. Make a .gitignore file and add the following lines to it. This will tell git not to track these files, and thus they won't be committed to Github.",
